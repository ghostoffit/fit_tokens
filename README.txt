Bachelor's project aimed at tokenization of human interactions in universities through a system of tokens and smart contracts that represent 
grades, points, bonuses, tokens for coffee machines, rewards for tuition assistance between students, and so on.

This is a research project that welcomes collaborations and teamwork!

All contracts are deployed on the Binance Smart Chain testnet.
